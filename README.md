# Movies-ETL
The purpose of this analysis was to extract, transform, and load (ETL) three different movie information files. I refactored code to create one function that takes in the three files (Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data) and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

Note: the .csv files were too large to be stored in a free GitHib account and were therefore added to my .gitignore. However, the files can be downloaded from the following link https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/download.
